This is the Etch-a-Sketch project of Foundations of The Odin Project.

The goal of the project is to build a webpage version Etch-a-Sketch using JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

The Grid Density buttons allow you to change grid density of the canvas area: 16x16, 32x32 (default), and 64x64. The Color buttons allow you to change paint color: Black (default), RGB (random rainbow color), or Gray (each pass adding some level of gray until the tile becomes fully black).
